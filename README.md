autoit script for renaming <snapshot.jpg> in the user's download folder to something else.  
  
reasoning:  
i often take snapshots via youtube, and they are saved in my download folder. they save by default as <snapshot.jpg> which is a pain having to rename every time. this script watches every second for <snapshot.jpg> and does the renaming for me, so i don't have to manually rename them before saving to avoid conflicting filenames. i have it set to be renamed as something involving time/date so it can be sorted alphabetically, but it could just as easily be set to save as something else.
