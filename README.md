autoit script for renaming snapshot.jpg in the user's download folder to something else.  

i often take snapshots via youtube, and they are saved in my download folder. it's a pain having to rename the snapshots everytime to avoid conflicting filenames. this script will check every second for snapshot.jpg, and if found, rename it to "YT (day) - (hour)(min)(sec).jpg" This allows me to quickly save snapshots without having to rename them.
